This project is classified for a reason. 
The implications of what we're doing here are far-reaching.
Governments, corporations, even the public â€“ they're not ready for this. 
But I am.
I believe in the potential of this technology to change the world.
To give sight to the blind, a voice to the voiceless.
The risks are immense, but so are the rewards.
