<p> ,which is besides the point. </p>
<p>    recently during my expeditions, i have discovered a pre-exodus artefact. the Old Ones (STWAI) called it 'node.js'. </p>
<p>    i've found an old text relating to it, but it's in some weird language. the data must be corrupted. </p>
<p>   so i started up this 'web log', as the Old Ones (STWAI) called it, to try and decipher what it means. </p>
 <p>  but i literally am a doctor of pre-exodian linguistics and corruption, so, won't take long. </p>
