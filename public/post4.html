<p>Finally, I've made real, actual progress!</p>
<p>But I'll leave that for later.</p>
<p>First, here's my AI play-around.</p>

    <p>Alright, so the 6BD censors the character combination '!@' (I don't know why. But I backslash-escaped to let me write it now.), so I'll write !@ a certain number of times, and encode the responses into a message.</p>
    <p>For example, if I wrote !@ ten times, the 6BD would write J, since J is the tenth letter.</p>
    <p>Here we go!</p>

    <p>Okay, now the decode.<br>
    It turns out, the pseudo-random code was actually just an ASCII code. <br>
    So I ran it into the 422-6AC-111, and it brute-forced its way into the following message (in the link below) </p>
